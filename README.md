The final project for course **CS-445 Computational Photography** at the **University of Illinois, Urbana-Campaign**.

In this project, we detected emotions of human faces and replaced the faces with corresponding emojis. For the faces whose orientations are not forward, we detected the orientations of the faces and applied transformations to emoji images. So that the orientations the emoji images can be the same as the faces.
